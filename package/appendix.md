# Appendix-簡便附錄教學

 有以下四個參數可以快速建構好附錄

• toc Put a header \(e.g., ‘Appendices’\) into the Table of Contents \(the ToC\) before listing the appendices. \(This is done by calling the \addappheadtotoc command.\) 

• page Puts a title \(e.g., ‘Appendices’\) into the document at the point where the appendices environment is begun. \(This is done by calling the \appendixpage command.\)

 • title Adds a name \(e.g., ‘Appendix’\) before each appendix title in the body of the document. The name is given by the value of \appendixname. Note that this is the default behaviour for classes that have chapters. 

• titletoc Adds a name \(e.g., ‘Appendix’\) before each appendix listed in the ToC. The name is given by the value of \appendixname. • header Adds a name \(e.g., ‘Appendix’\) before each appendix in page headers. The name is given by the value of \appendixnam
